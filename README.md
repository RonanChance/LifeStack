# Blockchain Powered Web-Application, LifeSTACK:

### Goal: 
Create a WebApplication that allows users to have a comfortable and safe homepage for their browser. LifeStack gives users the chance to store notes, read inspirational quotes, and find health recommendations specific to them. All this, with the comfort of data privacy granted by the magic of a decentralized blockstack identity!

### Result:
Users will find out the recommended healthy living habits for their area, learn how they can improve their community, and be given the contact information of local officials.

### Learning Experience

Our team worked together over the 36 hour Hoya Hacks Hackathon to create an application centered around social good. We practiced with a variety of technologies during the experience, such as:

- BlockStack / BlockChain
- MongoDB
- Javascript
- Python3
- HTML / CSS

### How To Run

If you are interested in testing out our application, great! 
Simply clone the repository with "git clone git@github.com:RonanChance/LifeStack.git"
Navigate to the directory inside the folder named "Blockstack"
In your terminal run "npm run start"
This should open a webpage/server in your default browser. Enjoy!
